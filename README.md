# note-taker
A Note Taker App

## Description

The motivation to creat this app was the need of note taking envirement. I needed the ability to store and delete notes as I pleased. This project solved the issue of not having web based application that could store notes on a server. This application allowed me to learn and practice my ability to deploy applications using Heroku.
